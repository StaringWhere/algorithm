- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
  
  You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
  #+END_QUOTE
- XOR is commutative, associative, self-inverse
- ```cpp
  class Solution {
  public:
      int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
          int num = 0;
          for (auto it : nums) {
              num ^= it;
          }
          return num;
      }
  };
  ```
