- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
  
  If the town judge exists, then:
  
  The town judge trusts nobody.
  Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
  There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
  You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.
  
  Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.
