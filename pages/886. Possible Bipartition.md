- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  We want to split a group of n people (labeled from 1 to n) into two groups of any size. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.
  
  Given the integer n and the array dislikes where dislikes[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that the person labeled ai does not like the person labeled bi, return true if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.
  #+END_QUOTE
- Two solutions
	- DFS or BFS to color the points and find conflicts. Notice that although dislikes are directed, the directions don't effect the grouping result, so treat them as undirected map.
		- ```cpp
		  class Solution {
		  public:
		      bool possibleBipartition(int n, vector<vector<int>>& dislikes) {
		          vector<int> flag(n);
		          vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
		          for (auto& dislike : dislikes) {
		              graph[dislike[0] - 1].push_back(dislike[1] - 1);
		              graph[dislike[1] - 1].push_back(dislike[0] - 1);
		          }
		          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		              if (!flag[i]) {
		                  flag[i] = 1;
		                  if (!color(graph, flag, i)) {
		                      return false;
		                  }
		              }
		          }
		          return true;
		      }
		      bool color(vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& flag, int from) {
		          for (int to : graph[from]) {
		              if (flag[to]) {
		                  if (flag[to] != 3 - flag[from])
		                      return false;
		              }
		              else {
		                  flag[to] = 3 - flag[from];
		                  if (!color(graph, flag, to)) {
		                      return false;
		                  }
		              }
		          }
		          return true;
		      }
		  };

	- Use Disjoint Set to union all the neighbor points.
