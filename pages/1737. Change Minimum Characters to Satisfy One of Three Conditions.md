- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  You are given two strings a and b that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in a or b to any lowercase letter.
  
  Your goal is to satisfy one of the following three conditions:
  
  Every letter in a is strictly less than every letter in b in the alphabet.
  Every letter in b is strictly less than every letter in a in the alphabet.
  Both a and b consist of only one distinct letter.
  Return the minimum number of operations needed to achieve your goal.
  #+END_QUOTE
- The core idea to let one array less than another is using a split line. Because lower case letters are finite, so we can use hashtable to sort.
- ```cpp
  class Solution {
  public:
      int minCharacters(string a, string b) {
          vector<int> count_a(26);
          vector<int> count_b(26);
          for (auto c : a) {
              count_a[c - 'a']++;
          }
          for (auto c : b) {
              count_b[c - 'a']++;
          }
          auto ops_distinct = [](vector<int>& count, string& str){
              return str.size() - *max_element(count.begin(), count.end());
          };
          int ops = ops_distinct(count_a, a) + ops_distinct(count_b, b);
          int diff_min = 200000;
          int diff_max = -200000;
          int diff = 0;
          for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
              diff += count_b[i] - count_a[i];
              diff_min = min(diff_min, diff);
              diff_max = max(diff_max, diff);
          }
          ops = min(ops, (int) a.size() + diff_min);
          ops = min(ops, (int) b.size() - diff_max);
          return ops;
      }
  };
