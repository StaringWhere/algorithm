- #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  You are given n points in the plane that are all distinct, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. A boomerang is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).
  
  Return the number of boomerangs.
  #+END_QUOTE
- The solution is quite easy, for each point, interate all the point to find identical distances. 
  At first, I thought it's better to let `j = i + 1`, so that for every two points, we only need to calculate the distance once. However, the two points i and j have different meanings in this problem, one is the base, one is the vertex. If we only calculate the distance once, we will need a nested map to store the distances of each pair of points, which is O(N^2). Moreover, in each interation, we need to consider i as the base and j as the base separately, makes the time complexity becomes O(2 * 0.5 * N) = O(N), eventually leading to a worse efficiency both in terms of time and space because of the nested map.
- ```cpp
  class Solution {
  public:
      int numberOfBoomerangs(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
          int count = 0;
          for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
              unordered_map<int, int> dist_count;
              for (int j = 0; j < points.size(); j++) {
                  if (i == j) { continue;}
                  int dist = (points[j][0] - points[i][0]) * (points[j][0] - points[i][0]) +
                          (points[j][1] - points[i][1]) * (points[j][1] - points[i][1]);
                  dist_count[dist] += 1;
                  count += (dist_count[dist] - 1) * 2;
              }
          }
          return count;
      }
  };
  ```
- An example of using nested map
- ```cpp
  int numberOfBoomerangs(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
      int count = 0;
      unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int, int>> dist_i_count;
      for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
          for (int j = i + 1; j < points.size(); j++) {
              int dist = (points[j][0] - points[i][0]) * (points[j][0] - points[i][0]) +
                      (points[j][1] - points[i][1]) * (points[j][1] - points[i][1]);
              dist_i_count[dist][i]++;
              count += (dist_i_count[dist][i] - 1) * 2;;
              dist_i_count[dist][j]++;
              count += (dist_i_count[dist][j] - 1) * 2;;
          }
      }
      return count;
  }
  ```
